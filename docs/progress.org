* [0%] Configurations
** DOIN styles, nuklear and other widget styles.
   - background color.
   - Font size, font selection.
* [66%] fully nuklear backend (utilizing app-surface and)
*** DONE keyboard callbacks, this writes to a buffer, apparently.
    - ~nk_input_key~ and ~nk_input_unicode~ carries the text input. But the
      input box details is unknown.
*** TODO draw another triangle above nuklear widget
*** DONE research the mouse clicking problem
    Nvidia driver specific problem.
* [33%] Taiwins-shell
** CANC lua support
   this can be *later*. It is very independent.
*** DOIN adding text to widget APIs.
** DOIN memory leak checking
*** Possible leaking ::
    - malloc but no free(I probably don't have that).
    - opened file without closing(socket, epoll, log file)
    - other system resources I am not aware of
    - libweston(-eglstream) leaks, since nvidia's implementation is not very
      serious
    - ~wl_callback~ :: there may be a wl_callback not destroyed. For this we
		       would have to store the wl_callback specifically

*** DONE nuklear memory checking
*** DONE cairo memory checking
** DOIN widgets support input events (this can be done through proxy events)
* [%] Taiwins-launcher
** implement launcher functions using ~nuklear~
* [%] Taiwins layouting method
